# Game-Reaper

A program that gathers data about a game from several third-party sites and gives you a short detail on the game that
you had searched.

Not only this, but you might be able to get download links to the game that is if you are not able to afford it
and yet if you still want to experience the gameplay. But, it is strictly mentioned that this project does not support
game piracy, and we recommend you to support the developers by buying the game from their official webpage.

This project was started as a project to test my web scraping skills, but I thought why not help some gamers to search
about games faster. It would be a lot of work to open a browser and search for a game to know more about it. If you are
a person who loves to use console or command line programs then this might be useful for you.

Please make sure to STAR the repository so that you won't miss out any latest updates ;)
